  <h1>Brace yourself, this is one ugly site</h1>
  <p>It pains me to leave these charts (and this site) as they are. Ugly, obviously mis-aligned, withouth correct axes labels.. shudder. Take a look at the readme on my <a href='https://github.com/ailyntang/d3Charts' target='_blank'>github repo</a> if you'd like to know why. I promise it's for a good reason!</p>
